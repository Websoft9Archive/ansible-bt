## What's PHP Runtime?

In addition to using the default settings of the BT deployment package, you may need to do more on the server:

- Modify PHP configuration file (php.ini)
- Add new BT or PHP application
- Configure the SSL/HTTPS
- Modify the root directory
- Binding Domain Name  
...

To complete these tasks, you need to refer to [Environmental Guidelines](/admin-runtime.md#guide)
